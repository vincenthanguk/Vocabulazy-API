# Vocabulazy API

The Vocabulazy API is the backend for the Vocabulazy flashcard web application, built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Passport for secure authentication. It provides a set of endpoints to manage user accounts and perform actions on decks, flashcards, and study sessions. The API enables users to create, edit, and delete flashcard decks, manage individual cards, and track study progress.
